Upgrade 14.X to 15.0
====================

.. note:: If you have addons on your site, make sure you have your addons upgraded to be Django 4.2 LTS compatible before upgrading your site to Tendenci 15.


Step 1: Prepare for Upgrade
---------------------------

Back up your site and database! Note that Django 4.2 supports PostgreSQL 12 and higher. So, if your PostgreSQL version is below 12, please upgrade before proceeding. 

Replace the content of the ``requirements/tendenci.txt`` with the following:
::

    tendenci>=15,<16
    
Update the conf/urls.py. Replace:
::

    from django.conf.urls import url, include
    
with the following, then in the `urlpatterns` list, replace `url` with `re_path`.
::

    from django.urls import re_path, include
    


We recommend to create a new virtual env instead of using the existing one.


Step 2: Upgrade Tendenci
------------------------

Run:
::

    cd /var/www/mysite/
    source /srv/mysite/bin/activate
    # For production sites, run
    pip install -r requirements/prod.txt --upgrade
    # For dev sites on your local, run
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt --upgrade
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py deploy
    python manage.py clear_cache


Step 3: Upgrade System Commands
-------------------------------

Replace the virtualenv in:
    - cron jobs 
    - systemd unit file. 

After update is done, restart your site.
